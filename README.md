The DriverPass project was a project that wanted to make dealing with setting up driving classes and test taking easier. The owner of the product, Liam, wanted to have a way for the DMV to have a better system to train students and better prepare them for the road test. The system was to have a way to schedule appointments, be able to pay for them, see upcoming classes and take tests or practice tests. I think I gathered information and was able to explain it really well in this project. I would pick my diagrams rto revise and possibly go over again, it wasn't my est work I feel. I had to read the transcript a few times in order to really make sure I was getting everyhting the user needed. This is important because you dont want to work on a project that you think is right rather than verifying it is everything the user wants.
